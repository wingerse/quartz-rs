# Custom Minecraft 1.8 server

To run, install rust, switch to nightly, and then do `cargo run --release`.

Chunk loading (only shitty generation), player movements, block placing (broken). Not sure if I'm going to continue.
There's too much work to do in trying to follow everything native minecraft does (Like, there's so many blocks and items, not to mention entities,
enchantments, attributes, various block properties, armor values etc..).
It would be more fun to create my own minecraft clone to be honest.
